<br/>By Sam Levine</h2>
<p id="poems">
<br/>The most unlikely of fairy tales
<br/>That is what we are
<br/>That is what I want us to be
<br/>But you do not always get what you want
<br/>Lessons are learned
<br/>People change
<br/>Time goes on
<br/>I just hope that you stay
<br/>It does not need to be a fairytale
<br/>That is what I keep telling myself
<br/>It does not need to be a fairytale
<br/>I will be lucky if anything happens at all
<br/>It does not need to be a fairytale…
<br/>Let me change
<br/>Let time pass
<br/>But do not let me leave

<h2 id="poemsH">  Help
<br/>By Sam Levine</h2>
<p id="poems">
<br/>I do not cry
<br/>It is just something I can’t do
<br/>As much as I try
<br/>Even if it is for you

<br/>I do not cry even when you do so
<br/>I am here for you
<br/>My hand on your shoulder, heart in tow
<br/>I am here for you

<br/>I can’t quite comprehend
<br/>Why you do not let me help
<br/>You say your heart is on the mend
<br/>It is something I have never felt

<br/>I want to be there for you every step of the way
<br/>You say it is best dealt with on your own
<br/>Eventually I figure it is okay
<br/>That’s when I call you on the phone

<br/>You say it does not help for me to worry
<br/>It is my choice to worry
<br/>I care about you
<br/>More than you know

<h2 id="poemsH">  A Poem?
<br/>By Sam Levine </h2>
<p id="poems">
<br/>I am not a poet
<br/>I do not know how to write poems
<br/>Heck, I don’t even like reading poems
<br/>Ironic is it not?
<br/>Yet, here I am
<br/>Writing a poem
<br/>I think
