  wack </br>
</br>We live in a society
</br>A society where everyone is anxious
</br>A society where everyone has friends
</br>But no one has a friend
</br>A society of social media
</br>Where people only show the best of themselves
</br>Or let their “close friends” know about the worst
</br>A society that frowns upon deviation
</br>That doesn’t want you to pursue what you love
</br>A society that sets expectations for you
</br>Creating this ever growing standard that causes kids to reach places of hopelessness
</br>Society mistreats us
</br>It forces us to embrace it when all we really want to do is shut ourselves off from it

  care</br>
<br/>I do not cry
<br/>It is just something I can’t do
<br/>As much as I try
<br/>Even if it is for you<br/>

<br/>I do not cry even when you do so
<br/>I am here for you
<br/>My hand on your shoulder, heart in tow
<br/>I am here for you<br/>

<br/>I can’t quite comprehend
<br/>Why you do not let me help
<br/>You say your heart is on the mend
<br/>It is something I have never felt<br/>

<br/>I want to be there for you every step of the way
<br/>You say it is best dealt with on your own
<br/>Eventually I figure it is okay
<br/>That’s when I call you on the phone<br/>

<br/>You say it does not help for me to worry
<br/>It is my choice to worry
<br/>I care about you
<br/>More than you know

  a poem? </br>
<br/>I am not a poet
<br/>I do not know how to write poems
<br/>Heck, I don’t even like reading poems
<br/>Ironic is it not?
<br/>Yet, here I am
<br/>Writing a poem
<br/>I think

</br>I want to cry
</br>But I can’t
</br>
</br>I need help
</br>But I don’t get it
</br>
</br>My stomach hurts
</br>My hands feel numb
</br>
</br>Is this an episode
</br>Will it pass
</br>
</br>Darkness seeps into my body
</br>Lonely, just how I like it
</br>
</br>But I know I need someone
</br>How do I do this alone
</br>
</br>Solutions are only temporary
</br>Nothing lasts forever
</br>
</br>Im not suicidal
</br>But why live, only to die

  fairytale</br>
<br/>The most unlikely of fairy tales
<br/>That is what we are
<br/>That is what I want us to be
<br/>But you do not always get what you want
<br/>Lessons are learned
<br/>People change
<br/>Time goes on
<br/>I just hope that you stay
<br/>It does not need to be a fairytale
<br/>That is what I keep telling myself
<br/>It does not need to be a fairytale
<br/>I will be lucky if anything happens at all
<br/>It does not need to be a fairytale…
<br/>Let me change
<br/>Let time pass
<br/>But do not let me leave
