      Here I have placed many of my creative projects and other endevours for the world
      to see. I hope to place a comment or feedback section where I can read what the
      people viewing this site have to say. The tabs at the top of the page can direct
      you to whichever item of mine you are interested in. Please note that all work on
      here is owned by me, including the site itself! Thank you for checking it out and
      please do enjoy!
