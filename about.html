      <h3>About Sam Levine</h3>
      <p>
        Greetings, I am Sam. Welcome to my website. I am not a very interesting person by any means. But, I do have a few interests that I would like to discuss as a way of showing off my personality. Well, first off, I love music, a-lot. I play the drums and have recently (as of writing this) started to learn the guitar. I mostly enjoy the soothing sounds of indie music, but I also enjoy punk, alternative, r&b, classic rock, dubstep, and a few more genres. I enjoy many things relating to art, but can often narrow that interest down to street or contemporary art. After reading about Aaron Rose, Mark Gonzales, Phil Frost, and all those guys I fell in love with that scene and style of art. In all honesty that and my art history teacher are a big reason as to why I create art in the first place.
</br></br>
I'm pretty into esports. There have been multiple periods of time in my teenage life where I thought about dropping everything to try and become a pro in certain video games. For those who don’t know what esports is, it’s essentially competitive video games, except these top guys get paid decent money and do it full time. After realizing that this dream was unlikely I have settled for being an avid viewer of multiple events such as the Overwatch League, the League of Legends Championship Series, CoD World League, most Counter Strike majors, and even Hearthstone tournaments. I also love my cat.

    <h3>  Why Did I Make This Site?</h3>
    <p>
      This site started out as a way of showing off my coding projects and what I have learned so far. I began with very simple HTML to get a layout for the site and then posted the games I had made in Java. Since then I have looked further into web development to try and modify my website so that it fits my ideal design.
</br></br>
The website has since shifted towards a portfolio of sorts, showcasing artwork of any kind that I have created. I do not want to set a limit on the type of content I will post on this site, but for now this is what I am focusing on. I would also consider this website itself to be one of my works of art.

      <h3>My Influences</h3>
      <p>
        In the 2018-2019 school year I took an art history class with one of the most passionate teachers I have ever met. I came into it thinking that the class would be just another way to get some credit, but instead it became much more than that. After learning about our first few contemporary artists I had become inspired by their art. The aesthetic of their lives, the places they lived, the time periods they lived in, the art they made, the way they carried themselves, it all left a mark on me. I went home one day and made my first work of art No Shade, which was admittedly made late at night as I procrastinated doing my homework. The nights following I drew out and painted Water Droplet. Without sounding entirely corny, this class opened my mind to the world of art, reaching into a space that I had not accessed since I was little. I attribute a lot of this growth to the teacher of this class who’s extreme passion for the subject transferred into her teaching.
</br></br>
  My Uncle. The fact that he has been able to maintain his very demanding full time job and continue his pursuit of art has been an inspiration alone. When he first found out that I had painted my own piece, he gifted me a set of acrylic paints and brushes during the holiday season. He also lent me a book about Aaron Rose and the Alleged gallery in New York, that was full of street art and a peek into that counterculture of the time. I showed him some of my work and seeing him express even the slightest appreciation for my work motivated me to continue with an even greater drive.
</br></br>
  Demetrius Harmon is a model, poet, actor, artist, and human. I first found him on twitter after seeing his skits appear many times on my feed. I followed him and soon found out about what a quality human being he is. He had dealt with mental health problems and came out a better person, creating an amazing clothing line titled, “You Matter”. His website hosts his poetry, modeling, store, and talks he has given. The format of this website alone has given me inspiration for my own site, but the content has also stuck with me. His modeling page has pushed me to take photos, not of myself, but of beautiful things in this world. His poetry has furthered my own passion for poetry, and his store pushing me to continue my art. I may never meet Harmon in person, but I hope that he knows the positive impact he has had on my thoughts.
