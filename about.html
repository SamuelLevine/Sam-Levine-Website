      About Sam Levine </br></br>
        My name is Sam Levine and I am currently 17 years old in my senior year of high school. I have a cat named
        Aviva whom I adore more than anything else in this world. I play the drums in a band named "The Vetts".
        I have been playing for about 3 years or so, and hope to contnue my passion of music
        alongside my eductation. In my early years my interest in video games was peaked with the release of
        Call of Duty: Black Ops. Since then I have expanded my interest to many other games including: Counter Strike:
        Global Offensive, Overwatch, League of Legends, Hearthstone, and many more. This passion for video games has
        also led me to pursue a great interest in esports, even leading me to create an esports club at my high
        school.

      My Coding Experience</br></br>
        While making this website I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Java, and web development in general.
        After taking AP Computer Science in my junior year of high school I had acquired a proficient level of
        knowledge in the Java language. This sparked my interest in game development and I created a few games,
        including some of the ones available for download on this site. After learning more about java and delving
        into some javascript (which is very similar to java) I felt that I needed a way to share what I know and what
        I have created. I then decided to try and teach myself the HTML and CSS languages in order to make a website.
        I began my learning with an HTML and CSS course on codeacademy.com, but I soon got bored of that approach to
        my learning. I took matters into my own hands and began learning the way many other people do, through youtube
        videos and forum posts.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This project has increased my interest in coding greatly, as I now have an idea of what developing a website is like.
        The process has been something that I enjoyed greatly. I have been able to utilize my creativity through the layout of the site, while
        also keeping the purpose of the site intact, to showcase my coding projects, art, music, and other. I hope to learn the basics of Unity and begin making basic 2D
        and possibly 3D games.

      My Influences</br></br>
      In the 2018-2019 school year I took an art history class with one of the most passionate teachers I had ever met. I came into it thinking that the class would be
      just another way to get some credit, but instead it became much more than that. After learning about our first few contemporary artists I had become inspired by their
      art. The aesthetic of their lives, the places they lived, the time periods they lived in, the art they made, the way they carried themselves, it all left a mark on me.
      I went home one day and made my first work of art No Shade, which was admittedly made late at night instead of homework. The nights following I drew out and painted Water
      Droplet. Without sounding entirely corny, this class opened my mind to the world of art, reaching into a space that I had not accessed since I was little. I attribute a lot
       of this growth to the teacher of this class whoâ€™s extreme passion for the subject transferred into her teaching.
</br></br>
My Uncle has his own passion for art and enjoys creating his own work as well. When he first found out that I had painted my own piece, he gifted me a set of acrylic paints and
brushes during the holiday season. The fact that he has been able to maintain his very demanding full time job and continue his pursuit of art has been an inspiration alone. Ever since
then, each time I create a new painting I show him my work and he continues his supportive attitude. Without making any bold assumptions, I believe that he truly does appreciate the world
of art, giving me more motivation to explore and create.
