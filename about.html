        &emsp;While making this website I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Java, and web development in general.
        After taking AP Computer Science in my junior year of high school I had acquired a proficient level of
        knowledge in the java language. This sparked my interest in game development and I created a few games
        including some of the ones available for download on this site. After learning more about java and a delving
        into some javascript (which is very similar to java) I felt that I needed a way to share what I know and what
        I have created. I then decided to try and teach myself the HTML and CSS languages in order to make a website.
        I began my learning with an HTML and CSS course on codeacademy.com, but I soon got bored of that approach to
        my learning. I took matters into my own hands and began learning the way many other people do, through youtube
        videos and forum posts.
