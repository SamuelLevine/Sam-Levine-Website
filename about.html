      <h1> <u>My Coding Experience</u> </h1>
      <p class="text">
        While making this website I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, Java, and web development in general.
        After taking AP Computer Science in my junior year of high school I had acquired a proficient level of
        knowledge in the Java language. This sparked my interest in game development and I created a few games,
        including some of the ones available for download on this site. After learning more about java and delving
        into some javascript (which is very similar to java) I felt that I needed a way to share what I know and what
        I have created. I then decided to try and teach myself the HTML and CSS languages in order to make a website.
        I began my learning with an HTML and CSS course on codeacademy.com, but I soon got bored of that approach to
        my learning. I took matters into my own hands and began learning the way many other people do, through youtube
        videos and forum posts.

        This project has increased my interest in coding greatly, as I now have an idea of what developing a website is like.
        The process has been something that I enjoyed greatly. I have been able to utilize my creativity through the layout of the site, while
        also keeping the purpose of the site intact, to showcase my coding projects.
