      What you are about to read is a collection of my thoughts, feelings, and ideas.
      Think what you want about the work, but it is filled with my heart and soul. I hope that you can enjoy it, and to those that do not,
      I hope that you can find something you do enjoy, because evidently it is not this. Most of these poems will have been written late at night as
      that is when most of my feelings truly come out. When the sun has set and the world outside is dark I can isolate myself to only me,
      some music, and my thoughts. Once again this has been an outlet for me to express my thoughts, feelings, and ideas without the construct of a format or others opinions.
      I would also like to mention that I am by no means a poet. What I have attempted to do here is create individual works of art using my emotion
      to make what resembles poetry. With that said, I hope you enjoyâ€¦
