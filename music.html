        This is a video of the 3rd show that my band and I have played. This was before we began work on our EP, so it
        consists of mostly covers. It was an unforgettable night and we played our hearts out, but there is still definitely
        room for improvement.

        This is a video of the 4th show that my band and I have played. We were invited to play at a crab feed that our high
        school's wrestling team was hosting. We were expecting a crowd of mostly adults, but the kids came up to the front
        and brought up the energy of the show.

      One night while talking on discord with my friends Alex (Lil Smeg) and Nolan (Yung Gweilo) we jokingly freestyled some dumb lyrics.
      We had so much fun with it that we decided to find some beats and write our own raps. Over the span of a few months we
      got together and recorded a full length album. We had an insanely fun time writing and recording these songs
      and they are not meant to be taken seriously, like at all...
